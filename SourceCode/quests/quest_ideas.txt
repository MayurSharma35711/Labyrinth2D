Some Ideas for Quests:
(still need to think about rewards)

you'll notice that i've included an 'insurance / bank' group
    - i think it would be interesting and make sense for something like this to exist, even in our small society
    - notably, some areas are extra dangerous and if people have children, they may want those kids to not be left unsupported
    - thus you take our insurance on yourself or on your source of income 
        - sort of like in the first types of historical insurance existing 
        - they are also very scummy and scammy in the same way :) 

i think it should be an option to kill an npc in areas where weapons are allowed to be used, however it should have consequences
could also be cool if killing npcs gave extra souls or something like that

some characters to include for the game 
- botanist (poison + earth)
- adventurer (air + ice)
- metal smith (fire + water)
- watchtower keeper (light + dark)

- these characters / types of characters could be in certain select locations, offer specific quests and items / experience
- they also have overarching missions
    - botanist: collect all the seeds and fancy rocks you find 
    - adventurer: uncover as much of all the minimaps as possible 
    - metal smith: show off cool armor sets and gear
    - watchtower keeper: tell NPCs you meet to go visit him (only for NPCs you know better) or keep a journal for him of all the people you've met

- if they offer specific items based on their elements (which don't match the neutral pairs exactly either) it would add extra interest I feel 
- also, all of these require the player to actually go out and explore the maze, dungeons and villages

- Thematic Quests
    - protect a lost child as he moves from 1 village to another 
    - help a pair of lovers meet by escorting one of them through a dungeon
        - they should get a little area to meet that is very pretty
    - help a village character find their lost friends 
        - one will be in a subdungeon
        - the other will be fending off monsters in the maze
        - the third is the subdungeon boss who you may almost kill 
            - (he'll have used human blood to hide among the monsters)
        - another will have been the remains of the human killed in the subdungeon 
            - perhaps they were killed by their friend 
    - a few of the villages are actively getting attacked by monsters or by crazy humans
        - defend them 
        - try to save as many people as possible
    - you run into an NPC and fight along side them and help them find something
        - you meet them a few other times later
        - you meet them later without an arm and leg
            - you can either save them (and they are fully crippled) or put them out of their misery
        - he describes the monster which did this to him 
            - you can choose to go and kill it and bring him back the trophy
            - bring it within an inch of its life and give it to him to kill 
            - get rid of all traces of it 
    - you have to haggle with the insurance group over what a kid should get for his father's death 
        - he will have tried to ensure that his kid will survive in the maze after his death 
    - you have to haggle with the hospital over helping your friend who needs a very specific potion they have
    - try to find yourself a house to live in
    - perhaps you also find a stall where you can sell some items (through an employee who runs the place)
        - this would give you some way to earn extra money, continue to want to be in the maze, and keep finding items
    - the casino tells you that someone ran away without paying their debt and want you to track them down
        - you can choose to pay their debt for them 
        - track them down and bring them back (they will die and they have a family)
        - see that they have a family and try to fight against the casino 
        - kill them yourself
    - if you complete various tasks like this, you can meet the head of the casino, the insurance group, and the hospital 
    - a villager tells you to look for their boyfriend in a subdungeon and 
        - you go there but realize that the monsters were originally human but were turned into monsters by the subboss
        - you realize after killing a few of them
        - you're given info about people who were lost by the villager
            - now you either have to defeat the subboss while fighting them to turn them back 
            - or kill them and defeat the subboss
        - if you kill them, it would be interesting if the villagers find out and kick you out of some areas 
    - some maze levels have extra subdungeons, leading to multiple villages 
        - some of these villages need help trading with one another 
        - one pair of these villages are raiding each other and you need to stop them from fighting 
            - they will have escorted 2 fighters each to fight outside of the maze, defeat them all and then talk to the villages
    - in one area, they need help to defeat the last of the monsters and start setting up a village
        - defeat some monsters left while protecting the builders
        - help them set up the protection spells required 
        - tell other people about this village 
    - some villages are set up near dangerous biomes 
        - help them recover after flooding 
        - help them recover after a volcanic eruption
        - save people after they an avalance and a blizzard
        - an area has a noxious disease get released
            - help them quickly make a potion for their cure 
            - give it to as many people as possible 
        

- Less Plot-heavy Quests
    - catch a specific fish 
    - get x specific monster parts for a potion
    - 'terraform' parts of the maze
        - using some items / spells / effects, maze tiles can change biome

    - dig up items that villagers have hidden in the maze 
    - Help them sell some of their items in other floors

        - hospital 
        - specialty stores
    - a few of the larger villages could also have sports / games to pass time 
        - some of these could be 2-on-2 play fighting
        - a strategy game like a simplified chess
        - hide and seek with some of the children
        - (reference for mayur) a card game like legend of ka'ah from big bang theory (deckbuilder to fight each other)
    - some areas might also have cats / dogs you can try to take to whatever home you have
    - get hired as a delivery person / messeneger for different villagers 
    - they ask you to find specific hidden areas
        - tunnels between different parts of the maze you can find using a shovel 
        - wishing wells / ponds / fountains hidden in the corner of a maze that gives you specialty buffs in exchange for debuffs
        - hidden subdungeons which is harder but gives a path to skip some levels
    - a little girl lost her pet cat / toy / ... somewhere in the maze, find and retrieve it
