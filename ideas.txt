Here we detail a rough breakdown of the ideas we have for the game and its different aspects. 

Equipment
- an equipment for each of the 4 limbs, plus a helmet and then armor. each will have different attack, health, effect, biome interactions, and stats, and will have different interactions when paired with other equipment and based on AI or player behavior.
- Weapons
	- Swords / mace / axe / spear (with effects obviously)
	- Guns / bow and arrows (with effects and range)
	- Some of the equipment could function as weapons
		- Gravity Gauntlet on right arm: this could have its own effects 
		- Fire gauntlet: have its own effects
- however, EVERYTHING has a counter

Monsters
- different tiers, having different ways of pathfinding, different interactions with players and their equipment, different damage and health stats, etc.
- higher tiers have smarter pathfinding algorithms
- we want a LOT of monsters
- do we want to have bosses to get to the next level?
- they drop loot and maybe items, however they can also pick these things up
- Rather than stats be generated by tiers it is generated based on specifics about the tiers i.e. (Tier 5 is all bad, Tier 4 is weak but slow, Tier 3 is slow but strong and has range ...)

Stores and Rooms 
- do we want a store and other cool (very varied, potentially procedurally-generated rooms) in the maze?


Combat
- most likely will be turnbased, but we should probably include this in the game division and game loop sections

Game Division / Loop (Proposed Idea)
- Computer first does the following (roughly simultaneously)
	- Biome interactions
	- monster interactions
- Then players also have the following (similar to Polytopia / Into the Breach)
	- An effect step (1)
	- A move step
	- A combat step
	- An effect step (2)

Rendering / Visual + Maze tranversal
- Have limited visibilty based on characters statistics
	- 3 modes of visibility
		- All see-ing visibility
		- Visibility obstructed by walls
		- Visibility set to a range but not by walls
- X marks the visited spots 
	- Can also have other AI which also have their spots noted in the view


Different Game Modes
- one game mode where you just choose the equipment and everything is simulated by the AI
- one game mode where you players can play against the AI and actually control their actions 
- another where they can play against other players all at the same time.

Biomes and Maze Properties
- different biomes affect different stats and AI behavior
- types would be lava, forest, water / river, marshy, snowy, desert, anti-gravity, dark (where monsters can surprise you more), poison fields, geyser fields, etc.
- gray spots on the map where a monster or treasure could suddenly appear
- destroyable walls
- areas where visibility decreases
- areas where the maze walls can move around a bit 
- areas where you can go under or over walls
- walls and map info have to be objects but they can be different
	- This is useful if info about them changes (gets burned, get deleted ...)


Packages to get Used to 
- Graphics
- Keyboard and Mouse Input 
- Networking (down the line with other people)

Algorithms Required 
- Maze generation (for the labyrinth)
- Map generation (will be overlaid by the labyrinth but useful to get the maze)
- Path finding (for the monsters and the AIs)
	- Will need to have different tuneable parameters based on characteristics the player wants to have (ie. risk-averse vs reckless, aggressive vs calm, long-range vs short range fighter, willingness to cooperate, ability to see further vs take time and the like)
- IMPORTANT(Given a position find info about walls and map(biome, monster pos...))
