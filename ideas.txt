Here we detail a rough breakdown of the ideas we have for the game and its different aspects. 

Equipment
- An equipment for each of the 4 limbs, plus a helmet and then armor. each will have different attack, health, effect, biome interactions, and stats, and will have different interactions when paired with other equipment and based on AI or player behavior.
- Weapons
	- Swords / mace / axe / spear (with effects obviously)
	- Guns / bow and arrows (with effects and range)
	- Some of the equipment could function as weapons
		- Gravity Gauntlet on right arm: this could have its own effects 
		- Fire gauntlet: have its own effects
- however, EVERYTHING has a counter
- Every armor has a different texture by character class

Saved
- Items can be saved after death if you die with those items

Monsters
- different tiers, having different ways of pathfinding, different interactions with players and their equipment, different damage and health stats, etc.
- higher tiers have smarter pathfinding algorithms
- we want a LOT of monsters
- do we want to have bosses to get to the next level?
- they drop loot and maybe items, however they can also pick these things up
- Rather than stats be generated by tiers it is generated based on specifics about the tiers i.e. (Tier 5 is all bad, Tier 4 is weak but slow, Tier 3 is slow but strong and has range ...)
- Different kinds of monsters change by region
	- But still mapped by tiers entailing that different biomes could have different monsters
- Leader monsters(when they get hurt they spawn more)
- Monster hotspots
- Certain monsters of high tiers have split mechanics
- Each biome could be based on a region
	- Different armors by region
- 1 to 2 S tier monsters per biome

Stores, Rooms and Chests
- Do we want a store and other cool (very varied, potentially procedurally-generated rooms) in the maze?
- Items spawn a LOT
- A chest spawns at starting position

Combat
- most likely will be turnbased, but we should probably include this in the game division and game loop sections
	- Energy
		- Every special item has an effect which when used take up a certain amount of energy
		- Energy has a cap and it grows by a certain amount each turn until the cap
		- Cap could be increased with certain items

Game Division / Loop (Proposed Idea)
- Computer first does the following (roughly simultaneously)
	- Biome interactions
	- monster interactions
- Then players also have the following (similar to Polytopia / Into the Breach)
	- An effect step (1)
	- A move step
	- A combat step
	- An effect step (2)

Rendering / Visual + Maze tranversal
- Have limited visibilty based on characters statistics
	- 3 modes of visibility
		- All see-ing visibility
		- Visibility obstructed by walls
		- Visibility set to a range but not by walls
- X marks the visited spots 
	- Can also have other AI which also have their spots noted in the view
- Have all the data about the map and biomes stored in an array
	- The visibility area is a container which draws itself given data about position and accesses the array with map and biomes
		- The sprites in the visibility container do not redraw themselves, rather the sprites stay the same but the textures changes
	- In this system all of the actual effects that go to the player are accessed through the big array of map data and not from visibility
- Every object should have a drawMe function which adds the texture to the main visibility container
	- The visibility container will be exported through different files
- Torches spawn randomly
- All textures have secondary textures
	- The textures are too bright

Graphics Optimization
	- Spritesheets
		- All textures are combined into one file and in that file each texture is given a position which is accessed when referenced
			- Browsers are limited by file fetching so combining them into one is optimal
	- Use PIXIJS built in keyboard input/mouse imputs
		- This will be more efficient as it will be more compatible with our other code
	- Containers
		- Visibility is a container and it has the sub-visibilities of all players
		- This makes it easy to access different objects as all objects will be loaded through this
		- If anything happens to the container it automatically happens to the children
			- This loads computation off of the CPU to the GPU which allows it to run faster

Different Game Modes
- one game mode where you just choose the equipment and everything is simulated by the AI
- one game mode where you players can play against the AI and actually control their actions 
- another where they can play against other players all at the same time.

Biomes and Maze Properties
- different biomes affect different stats and AI behavior
- types would be lava, forest, water / river, marshy, snowy, desert, anti-gravity, dark (where monsters can surprise you more), poison fields, geyser fields, etc.
- gray spots on the map where a monster or treasure could suddenly appear
- destroyable walls
- areas where visibility decreases
- areas where the maze walls can move around a bit 
- areas where you can go under or over walls
- walls and map info have to be objects but they can be different
	- This is useful if info about them changes (gets burned, get deleted ...)

Packages to get Used to
- Graphics
- Keyboard and Mouse Input 
- Networking (down the line with other people)

Algorithms Required 
- Maze generation (for the labyrinth)
- Map generation (will be overlaid by the labyrinth but useful to get the maze)
- Path finding (for the monsters and the AIs)
	- Will need to have different tuneable parameters based on characteristics the player wants to have (ie. risk-averse vs reckless, aggressive vs calm, long-range vs short range fighter, willingness to cooperate, ability to see further vs take time and the like)
- IMPORTANT(Given a position find info about walls and map(biome, monster pos...))

Levels
- Backround biome could be different for each level
- Items in chests could be different
- Overall monster spawning could be different

stats
- Visibility
	- Max amt of blocks you can see
- Speed
	- Maximum amt of blocks you can travel per turn
	- If the setup is plain, lava, plain then if your speed is two while walking over the lava you do not get effects
- Strength
	- Damage you can do
- Range
	- Max amt of blocks your hits can hit from
- Protection
	- If damage done is 13,  health is 10, and protection is 10
	- Then damage taken is 13 - 10 = 3
	- And protection remaining is 0
		- It will grow back in a set amt of turns which is on the stack
- Health
- Shield Regeneration
	- How fast your protection regenerates
